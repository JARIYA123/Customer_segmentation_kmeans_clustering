# # Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Problem Statement

Businesses want to understand customer behavior to improve marketing strategies.This project groups customers into different segments based on their Annual Income and Spending Score using K-Means clustering.

## 🎁 Algorithm

K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions data into K distinct, non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) by minimizing the distance between data points and their cluster centroid.

## 📊 Dataset

1. Mall Customer Dataset
2. CustomerID
3. Gender
4. Age
5. Annual Income (k$)
6. Spending Score (1–100)
Mall Customer Dataset from kaggle(source)

## 🔔Steps

1. Load and explore data
2. Apply Elbow Method
3. Train K-Means model
4. Visualize clusters

## 📈 Output Explanation

Each color represents a customer segment ,
Businesses can target: 
High income – high spenders ,
Low income – low spenders ,
Potential customers .
Customers were successfully grouped into 5 distinct clusters.
